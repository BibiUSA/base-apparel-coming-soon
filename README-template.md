## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly


### Links

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://bibiusa.github.io/base-apparel-coming-soon/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript


### What I learned

I learned about how to validate email and how to prevent a page from refreshing when pressing a button or pressing enter. I also learned how to listen for the keypress enter as another option instead of having the client press the enter button. Other things I learned include issues that can come with absolute positioning when minimizing screen size.

### Continued development

I need to continue practicing CSS and Javascript. Especially making the web page responsive when going to mobile screens. I plan on looking at how other people solved this challenge on frontend mentor to see other approaches to similar problems and to look for rooms for improvement.
